title: Improving Async Communication
---

- Download a world clock app to keep track of multiple timezones and add custom labels for different time zones your team works in
-  Find the timezone overlap. Team members should have quick response times (i.e. less than 5 min) during these hours
- Push WIP to your code managemnt platform (Gitlab, Github) at the end of each day and move your task back in `to do` Explain what you have completed and what is left to be done. This will help push the sprint goals forward and avoid resorting to backlog work prematurely
- Post to your communication platform to ask questions as-if everyone is online. This documents the question, allows the possibility for someone else to answer your question, and it gives other contributors time to research or gather their thoughts if it needs to be discussed as a group
- Resolution Notice - If your question or discussion has been resolved. Add a comment that says `Resolved`
- Before standup/scrum, a dedicated developer can skimcreate bullet points for unresolved questions
