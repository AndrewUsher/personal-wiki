title: Intro To Scrum
---

- All work is divided into sprints
    - Requirements, design, code, integration, test, deploy
- All sprints must have some functioning demo at the end
- Teams all have functioning parts
- Challenges: hard to practice, takes commitment
- No two items can be exactly the same priority
- Progress is how much work is finished, not started

## Roles in Scrum

- Product owner
    - Responsible for ROI
    - Final arbiter of requirements questions
    - Focused more on what than how
- Scrum Development Team
    - Cross functional group
    - Attempts to build a potentially shippable product increment each sprint
    - Works together
    - Self-orgainizing
- Scrum master
    - Has no management authority
    - Doesn't have project manager role
    - Facilitator

## Artifacts

### Product Backlog

- Everything we might ever do
- Must go through product owner
- Must be prioritized
- Force ranked

### Sprint Backlog

- Everything that needs to be done during current sprint

## Meetings

- Sprint Planning Meeting
    - Plan items for next sprint
- Daily Scrum
    - Yesterday, today, blockers
- Sprint Review Meeting
    - Demo to product owners and other business people
- Sprint Retrospective Meeting
    - Look at what was good, bad about last sprint
    - Refine your team's process
- Backlog Refinement Meeting
    - Backlog Grooming

## Backlog Refinement Meeting

- Prioritize backlog items
- Good backlog items are independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, testable
- Epic: collection of user stories
- Acceptance criteria: minimum functionality product requires to be considered 'done'
- Product owner is responsible for prioritizing items
- Get better understanding of volume of upcoming work

## Sprint Planning Meeting

- Product owner and dev team agree on sprint goals and move items from Product backlog to current sprint
- Part 1: commiting to product backlog items
- Part 2: coming up with individual tasks
- Longest sprint: 30 days
- Do entire process in one sprint

## Daily Scrum Meeting

- Should only be 15 minutes
- Parking lot: items not directly related to updates or blockers
    - General concerns

## Sprint Review Meeting

- Open to everyone
- Live demo
- Product owner declares what's done
- Measure of velocity
- Get feedback from stakeholders

## Sprint Retrospective Meeting

- Safety check
- ORID
    - Objective questions (what happened?)
    - Reflective questions (how do we feel about it?)
    - Interpretive questions (what does it mean?)
    - Decision Questions (what are we going to do about it?)
- Postit notes with observations about the previous sprint
    - Get actions to improve next sprint

## Deinition of Done

- Checkout and build are fully reproducible
- Manual, exploratory testing
- Messy/poorly designed code has been cleaned up through refactoring
- Duplicate code removed through refactoring
- Code is written together or at least reviewed
- Regression tests for new functionality run during new builds

## Product Backlog Items and Tasks

- A PBI is more about the what than the how
- A task is more about the how
- Well formed PBI represents distinct business value, ideally from customer's perspective
- Task is no bigger than one day of work
- Product backlog should contained PBIS, not tasks
