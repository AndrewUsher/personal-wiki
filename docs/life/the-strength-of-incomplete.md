title: The Strength of Incomplete
---

- Most of us struggle to finish something, because most of us don’t dare to start in the first place
- We often dread, fear, and feel downright ashamed for unfinished work 
- It’s more comfortable to feed our ego based on fictions and tales of future success, instead of getting our hands dirty and being confronted with our own shortcomings
- We might realize that our idea is not as original as we thought, that we aren’t quite able to build or visualize what we had envisioned, or that we simply lack willpower and conviction to push through the mental hurdles that get thrown our way
- In order to understand how we can leverage it to get more done, build better products, and design more compelling experiences, we need to understand how unfinished affects our mind

## An Unsettling Bill

- Unfinished tasks loom larger than finished ones.
  - Unfinished tasks lead to cognitive tension, a feeling of restlessness and discomfort that makes us seek closure and come back to it again and again
- There are three ways that anyone who is building and designing products can use this to their advantage

### Creative output

- Things endowed with momentum want to keep moving
- Indeed, what we learned is that once you start a task—without completing it—you will find yourself thinking of the task until, step by step, you eventually finish it
- While some open tasks create momentum that bring us closer to our goals, some actively prevent us from it
- Keeping track of a bunch of unfinished emails and notifications before going to sleep is not just a recipe for bad dreams: it’s a waste of mental space
- Therefore, we’re better off by exposing ourselves to uncomfortable and challenging problems instead.
  - By starting out on a task and allow for deliberate, longer interruptions, we can effectively reach our goal faster
- Accept the messiness of unfinished and use its momentum to increase your creative output

### Keeping People’s Attention

- Trailers, teasers, and promotions all lean into the power of unfinished 
  - They give insights about the conflict, without revealing how the conflict is resolved 
  - Titles of articles and videos ask questions with subtle hints to the answer, while savvily leaving out the answer itself
  - Movies with abrupt ends, get debated, while the ones with predictable ends get forgotten
- Use the power of unfinished to instill suspense and interest for the content and products you think matter

## Conclusion

- The power of unfinished is the power of starting. 
- Once we start something, our brain starts rewiring itself
- Unfinished is an inevitable precondition for finished and we can expose both ourselves and others to its momentum
